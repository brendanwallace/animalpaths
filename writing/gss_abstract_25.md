If you step off a sidewalk and cut through the grass, your foot prints leave an indentation and making it easier for the next person to taket he same shortcut.
Over time, this positive feedback can form what's called a desire path. When an animal does it, it's called a game trail.
These trails can form entire networks, as in the case of Michigan State University, where walking paths were allowed to form organically in the lawn before being paved, or in the case of bear trails observed in Alaska. Across domains, these trails share a distinct organic shape. Yet little is known of the dynamics of this process, or how stable or efficient these networks are.

In this talk I'll provide background and then explore the dynamics of these emergent trail networks using a simulation model.
<!-- 
Walking agents move between points of interest in a 2-dimensional space, creating low-cost of regions trail, and taking the least-cost path to their destination. We find that such a model produces highly intricate networks across a range of scenarios, and we explore 


When presented with different rates of trail formation and decay, walkers produce appropriately minimal network that minimize travel costs for a given sustainable amount of trail. 
We show a simple relationship between the relative cost of traveling off the path and the angles at which trails meet in the network, and investigate the dynamics of the process. -->
