Abstract:

When you step off the pavement and walk through the grass, you flatten it down and make it easier for another person to walk the same way. This creates a positive feedback loop, as the next person flattens it further, making it easier still, etc., and over time creating a trail. In the urban design world, this kind of trail is called a desire path; when it's formed by animals in the wilderness it's called a game or animal trail. These trails can overlap and interact in larger unpaved urban areas, snowy landscapes, grassy wilderness areas, etc., to form a network, connecting multiple points of interest or spanning the space in some way.

This talk will overview a computational model of the formation of such emergent networks. It will highlight key results of the current approach, and discuss some implications of understanding their dynamics in the realms of animal behavior, urban design and collective behavior/computation.


There are three main implications to understanding the dynamics of such networks. First, understanding animal behavior in the wild, especially inferring such from the networks that we can easily observe. Second, understanding human (especially pedestrian) behavior with some implications for the design of urban spaces. And third, we can think of active walkers as trying to collectively solve the problem of minimizing their travels costs while simultaneously minimzing the amount of path they lay down, some variations of which have been shown to be NP-hard.

This talk will first contextualize and introduce the model, discuss some results, and 




This process can be thought of as a temporally distributed collective behavior which embeds navigational knowledge into the landscape. At the same time, this process of path formation isn't fully cooperative: each person walks in a way that optimizes their own travel costs and comfort, and by all doing so, they together negotiate an allocation of a scarce infrastructure resource (that is, where to place the path) in a way that is efficient and/or stable.

This talk will overview some methodology and rationale of how to model a multi-agent complex system, and some interesting and surprising theoretical background of efficient transportation networks. It will discuss an earlier and seminal modeling approach, open questions, and the current approach with some early results and implications.



Abstract:

When a person or animal walks through rough terrain, they flatten it down and make it easier for the next person or animal to walk the same way. This establishes a positive feedback loop as subsequent walkers flatten the path further, and over time form a trail. In the urban design world, this kind of trail is called a desire path; when it's formed by animals it's called a game or animal trail. These trails can overlap and interact in larger unpaved urban areas, snowy landscapes, grassy wilderness areas, etc., to form a network, connecting multiple points of interest or spanning the space in some way. Understanding the shapes, properties, and dynamics of these networks can help us better understand animal behavior, and human (especially pedestrian) behavior with implications for the design of urban spaces.

This talk will overview a computational model of the formation of such emergent networks. It will highlight some observational and analytical findings, and discuss their implications.

He's interested in using a multi-disciplinary approach to modeling complex systems, in particular those related to movement ecology and crossovers between ecological and human/urban systems. Brendan completed his BS in applied math at Brown University, his MS in applied math at the University of Washington, and previously worked on the team that models and predicts road speeds and travel times for Google maps.
